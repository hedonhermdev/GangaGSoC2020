# Ganga Initial Task

### Hello World
  Run the [hello_world.py](./hello_world.py) file to see a demonstration of a simple job. 
   
   `python hello_world.py`


### Demonstrating the Arg Splitter

  * Splitting the PDF ([pdf_split.py](./pdf_split.py)): 
  
    `python pdf_split.py`
    
  * Making a job and splitting it into subjobs ([ganga_job_splitter.py](./ganga_job_splitter.py)): 
  
    `python ganga_job_splitter.py`
   
  * The total count of all occurrences of the word 'the' is stored in a file named 'stdout'. Print the file to get the result:
    `cat stdout` 


Note: The ganga namespace is imported in both files. So it is perfectly fine to run the file with either the python or the ganga interpreter.
